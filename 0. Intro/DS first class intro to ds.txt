Data = any data not totally determined.
Information = any data with specific proper info

Ram Memory =  primary memory
HDD	   = secondary storage

Data Structure = Logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data is called a data structure.

Two type:
1: premitive DS = integer, real, character, boolean
2: Non-primitive DS :
	1: Linear DS = Array, linked list, stacks, queue = Sequenced maintained Data
	2: Non-linear DS = Trees, Graphs = No sequenced maintained Data like relation


Stack = Bunch of plates input. first input will be in the bottom. We can delete the last plate.
Queue = It's kind of linear list. Insert is enqueue from back, Delete is deque from front.
           Like a line in a counter service  -> back ||||||| <- front


Data Structure Operations:
Traversing : Look at every record .
Search : to search any data.
Insert : To inter a data.
Delete : to remove a data.
Sorting : Arranging the records in some logical order.
Marging: Combining the records in two different sorted files into a 
single sorted file.  Like two file into one file.


Abstract Data Types(ADT):
An abstract data type refers to a set of data values and associated
operations that are specified accurately, independent of any particular implementation.
Mainly means, ADTs are entities that are definitions of data and operations but don't have implementation details.

Time Complexity Algorithm:
Matters,
Time: The worst case . How fast a program can run.
Space/Memory: How much it eats the ram/space.

Method:
Asymptotic Analysis: The average case.
Big O Notation: The worst case notation.
